ORM : object Relational Mapping(ORM) bridge between object-oriented programs and relational databases

ORM Tool :software designed to help OOP developers interact with relational databases. So instead of creating your own ORM software from scratch, you can make use of these tools.

Entity Framework
Entity Framework is an open-source ORM framework for .NET applications supported by Microsoft. It enables developers to work with data using objects of domain specific classes without focusing on the underlying database tables and columns where this data is stored


There are two path to connect with database
Code-First and Database-First Approaches

Code First Approach
1.Define your model classes, each class corresponds to a table in your database.
2.Create a DbContext class that inherits from the DbContext class provided by Entity Framework.
3.Enable migrations, this way you can update the database schema so that the database and your models are still in sync. Use the package manager console to enable the migrations, use the Enable-Migrations command to do that, and create a migration with the Add-Migration <MigrationName> command.
4.Create the database, through the package manager console, use the entity framework to create the database and the table. Also, you need to write a command for that which is the Update-Database command.
